# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I made this webpage because I wanted to learn a new skill. I built it so i can track what i have reviewed so far and what to expect from the bootcamp. I have learned some basic processes in HTML, CSS, Git Bash, vs code, and Javascript.


If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
